## Overview

 - This is my first Milestone 1 project which is part of the Code Instituteâ€™s FullStack Software Development Diploma Course. This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge of the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 7 and User Centric Frontend Development modules which I have learned recently on the course. 
 - The aim of this fictional website is to promote The Hikers group on the market, make the group recognizable and to present their offer of organized trips in the Irish mountains for people looking for adventure, unforgettable experiences, interested in discovering Irish mountain trails, spending time actively.

## UX

This website design will target people of different age groups and families from the country as well as visitors to ireland hence its purpose is an overall simple but effective eye catching website. The priority is direct contact and links to social media.

1. Strategy

My goal in this project is to promote the group on the market and increase interest in the tours they offer and grow their bussiness by providing the UX simple, clean and user-friendly. 

### Bussiness goals:
- Promote the new group on the market
- Demonstrate examples of tours to show customers what they can expect
- Increase the number of followers on social media
- Encouraging to spend time actively and discover beautiful Ireland

### Customer Goals:
- Easy to read information About Us, long enough to understand the content but not to overwhelm.
- Easy to find contact details to ask questions or book a trip
- Easy to find the address and location of the group
- Easy to find links to social media accounts to follow as well as see what new the group is organizing
- Easy to find video of existing trips which the group offer
- Design with mobile devices in mind as this is probably the most common way to find information
- Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
- Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

2. Scope

I chose the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach which:
- It provides users with pure UX
- It includes mobile-first website that is responsive on all devices.
- It fits with my current skills.
- It defines content quickly and focuses on contacting via email or social media. 

3. Structure

The main purpose of the structure is to enable users to quickly navigate through the website, easily assimilate information and have overview through images and videos from the trips to show what can be expected by buyers on the offered trips. A selection of high-quality images that gives special accent for the website. Contact details are provided via the e-mail contact form  and links to social media in the footer.
